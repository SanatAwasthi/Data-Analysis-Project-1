# Data-Analysis-Project-1
A personal project based on the dataset fetched from Jira related to tickets that I worked on during the period of three months. 
Do note that I have maintained utmost privacy while dealing with the data. How that is maintained is also showcased using python.

This project aims to do following things:

1. Introduce me to various python libraries
2. Teach myself the application of the used libraries
3. Answer specific questions that would give insights into future course of actions

Libraries used: Pandas, OS, Pathlib,matplotlib,seaborn

Questions:

1. Give us an insight as to inflow of data request in our team in each month
2. Which individuals required most data in each month?
3. What kind of data request was mostly required each month?
